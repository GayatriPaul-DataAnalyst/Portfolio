# Project 1: Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

This is the case study from Google Analytics Capstone Project.

Cyclistic- a fictional bike sharing company in Chicago, is interested in converting non-member users into annual members. My goal here is to find out key differences between the two groups and share recommendations based on the analysis.
